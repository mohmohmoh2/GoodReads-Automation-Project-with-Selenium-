# GoodReads Automation Project with Selenium &amp; TestNG

🚀 Excited to share my latest project: GoodReads Automation 🚀

As part of this project, I worked on automating key features using Selenium and TestNG with a focus on delivering scalable and maintainable test cases.

Here are some of the key techniques and tools I utilized:

🛠 Selenium for robust web automation
🧪 TestNG for efficient test management
🏗 Page Object Model (POM) for clean and structured code
🚀 GitHub Pipelines for continuous integration and smooth test execution
Automation is an integral part of enhancing quality and efficiency in software delivery, and this project has been a rewarding step in that journey!
